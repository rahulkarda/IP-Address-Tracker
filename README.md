[LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.

[IPify](https://www.ipify.org/) API is a simple public IP address API.

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/21.84/82.79) is a free wiki world map, an open volunteer-driven initiative to collaboratively create a map of the world, and release the map data under a free and open license.

## Optimizations
While improve this project, I would start by implementing the following features -

   1. <s>Adding domain name tracker</s>
   2. List of famous sites for users to search   
   
              
## Lessons Learned
I learned the basics of IP and Domain Name System and the how the data packets get transferred on the Internet. I learned how to integrate OpenStreetMap API and IPify API to get the user's IP Address and map it according to the location. I learned about API management and how the API serves a request and how can it help in improving businesses.
